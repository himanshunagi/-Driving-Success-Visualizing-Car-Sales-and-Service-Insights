# Driving Success: Visualizing Car Sales and Service Insights

Part 1:
As a regional manager, I created visualizations to understand car sales and profits for each dealer. Key tasks and visualizations included:

1. "Quantity Sold" by "Dealer ID": Bar chart sorted by sales quantity, titled "Quantity Sold by Dealer ID."
2. "Profit" by "Date" and "Model": Line chart titled "Profit by Date and Model."
3. "Profit" by "Year" and "Dealer ID": Column chart with red data columns, titled "Profit by Year and Dealer ID."
4. "Sum of Profits" for "Hudson model cars" by "Dealer ID": Line chart with green series outline, titled "Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID."
Workbook saved as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx.

Part 2:
Two dashboards were created:

1. "Sales" dashboard: Tabbed template with small rectangles:

Panel 1: "Profit" formatted in millions of USD.
Panel 2: "Quantity Sold."
Panel 3: "Quantity Sold by Model" as a bar chart.
Panel 4: "Average Quantity Sold."
Panel 5: "Profit" by "Dealer ID" as a column chart.

2. "Service" dashboard: 2x2 rectangle areas tabbed template:

Panel 1: "Number of Recalls per Model of Car" as a column chart.
Panel 2: Customer sentiment comparison (positive, neutral, negative) as a treemap.
Panel 3: "Quantity of Cars Sold per Month" compared to profit as a line and column chart.
Panel 4: "Number of Recalls" by model and affected system as a heat map.

These dashboards provide valuable insights for sales and service departments.
